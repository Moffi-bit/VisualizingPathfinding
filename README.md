# Visualization of Pathfinding Using JavaFX!

## Dependencies Needed:
* JavaFX

## How to use:
```
mkdir Pathfinding
cd Pathfinding
git clone https://github.com/Moffi-bit/VisualizingPathfinding.git
```

## Future Improvements

* [x] Basic pathfinding (without walls)
* [x] Improved user interface (e.g menu, help, etc)
* [x] Improved how walls can be placed (e.g holding the mouse down and dragging)
* [ ] Improved the pathfinding algorithm to work for all/most cases
